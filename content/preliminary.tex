\section{Working Voltage for the Photomultipliers}
As a first step, the optimal working voltages for the photomultipliers (PMTs) have to be found.
Two PMTs were chosen for this measurement as a sample from the whole detector, \texttt{R10B} and \texttt{R20A}.
It is important to choose PMTs from different planes to make sure the measured signal is due to a 
particle crossing the detector. A schematic for the measuring circuit is shown in \autoref{fig:hvscematic}.\\

Only signals measured with both PMTs are taken into account. To determine these coincidences 
logic signals are needed and for this, discriminators with a threshold of $\SI{40}{mV}$ are used. 
They convert the analogous signals of each PMTs into NIM standard signals. Using a logic unit module, we get
the coincidences from the logic \texttt{AND} of both PMT signals. The NIM signals 
last for $\SI{40}{\ns}$ each so the signals do not have to arrive at the same time but within 
$\SI{40}{\ns}$ of each other because the muons arrive in the different planes at different times 
and not necessarily at the same distance from the PMTs. Furthermore, the PMTs may have different
delay times as well.\\
\vskip 0.09 cm
For the measurement, the \texttt{R10B} PMT works on a fixed high voltage of $\SI{775}{V}$ while the high voltage of 
\texttt{R20A} is varied from $\SI{700}{V}$ to $\SI{900}{V}$. Each measurement lasts $\SI{200}{s}$.
The taken data is shown in \autoref{fig:hv}. A plateau can be found with $\SI{875}{V}$ corresponding to the middle value 
of it. This value is used as a fixed value for the \texttt{R20A} PMT when the voltage of the \texttt{R10B}
PMT is varied in the same range of high voltages. The measurements for this PMT were each taken in $\SI{100}{s}$ due to 
time limitations.
The central value of the plateau for this PMT is $\SI{825}{V}$.
Both measurements were also stopped when the PMTs are operating in the discharge region due to the high voltage to avoid damaging the PMTs.\\
\vskip 0.09 cm
The results are shown in \autoref{fig:hvPMT1} and \autoref{fig:hvPMT2}. All uncertainties are obtained 
assuming a Poissonian distribution, meaning $\sigma \propto \sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of
coincidences. Because the output of the high voltage sources can fluctuate, the central values of the plateaus, $\SI{875}{V}$ for the \texttt{R20A} PMT and 
$\SI{825}{V}$ for the \texttt{R10B} PMT, can be used as the optimal working voltages to ensure
a voltage output in the region of the plateau.

\section{Threshold measurements}
After the optimal working voltages was found, the determination of the optimal threshold voltage of the chosen PMTs started.
A good determination of the threshold is necessary to suppress electronic noise on the one hand, but also to make sure that real signals are not
filtered as well on the other hand. So the threshold can neither be too low nor too high.\\
\vskip 0.09 cm
Similar to the step before, a counting experiment of coincidences concerning the threshold voltages is conducted. This time the circuit arrangement is shown in 
\autoref{fig:threshold_scematic} is used. The PMTs are powered using the working voltages given 
in the laboratory as an average optimal working voltage for three PMTs. \\

In principle, the threshold of the discriminator of one plane is kept fixed at $\SI{15}{mV}$, while 
the threshold of the other discriminator is being varied from $\SI{5}{mV}$ to $\SI{250}{mV}$ in irregular steps. 
Using a discriminator and a Fan-in-Fan-out system as shown in \autoref{fig:threshold_scematic}, it is possible to vary the threshold of the discriminators of both PMT planes at the same time. Each counting measurement was conducted in $\SI{60}{s}$.\\ 
The results for the \texttt{R10} and \texttt{R20} planes can be seen in \autoref{fig:threshR10R20}.
Results from other planes have to be taken from \autoref{sec:appendix}, figures \autoref{fig:appthresh1} to \autoref{fig:appthresh6}.\\
\input{../content/treshtable.tex}
The data shows a higher number of coincidences at low threshold voltages, which decreases with rising voltages.
This behavior is the same for all PMTs although not all curves show it that clearly.  
Also, a plateau of optimal threshold voltages can be seen. From the middle of this plateau, a threshold voltage 
has to be chosen as the optimal threshold value. As before the uncertainties will be taken 
into consideration using the Poissonian error. The optimal threshold voltages of all PMTs are shown in 
\autoref{tab:thresh}.
Note that for the \texttt{L10} signals and the \texttt{R10} signals two measurements 
were taken. Thus, in these cases, only the value from the curve where it is easier to detect
where the plateau is will be taken into consideration.
The other values are marked italic in the tabular.

\section{Delay Curve}
With systematical variation of the delay between the PMTs \texttt{R10} and \texttt{R20} a delay 
curve for these PMTs can be created. This delay curve is shown in \autoref{fig:delay}.
For this measurement delay is added to the signals and the coincidences are counted using scalers in 
a $60 \; \symup{s}$ timeframe. With the usage of a Fan-In-Fan-Out module the same delay 
can be applied to both signals at the same time. \\
The delay curve describes the number of coincidences measured for various delays between the PMTs.
A negative delay time indicates a delay for the signal of \texttt{R10}, while a positive delay 
represents a delay of the signal of \texttt{R20}. The flanks of the curve can be fitted with linear 
functions of the form 
\begin{equation*}
    N(\Delta t) = a \cdot \Delta t + b
\end{equation*}
with $N$ as the number of coincidences and $\Delta t$ as the delay time. 
The parameter are 
\begin{align*}
    a_{\text{left}} = (64.9 \pm 7.6)\; \symup{\frac{1}{ns}} \qquad
    b_{\text{left}} = 2328.6 \pm 251.4
\end{align*} 
for the left flank from $-36\;\symup{ns}$ to $-25\;\symup{ns}$ and    
\begin{align*}
    a_{\text{right}} = (-49.4 \pm 6.3)\; \symup{\frac{1}{ns}} \qquad
    b_{\text{right}} = 1972.6 \pm 227.3
\end{align*} 
for the right flank in the interval $32\;\symup{ns}$ to $40\;\symup{ns}$.
The plateau between the two flanks has an average value of $343.3 \pm 18.6$. With the estimated 
parameters and the plateau value the time values of the half maximums are 
\begin{equation*}
    \Delta t_{\text{left}} = -33 \pm 5 \qquad
    \Delta t_{\text{right}} = 36 \pm 7.
\end{equation*}
Thus, the full width half maximum can be estimated as 
\begin{equation*}
    \Delta t_{\text{FWHM}} = 70 \pm 9
\end{equation*}
which is a measure for the resolution of the PMTs.

    Furthermore, linear fits of the flanks and the FWHM are plotted.}

\section{TDC callibration}
To convert the TDC time units into real time units the various TDC channels have to be callibrated.
In this step malfunctioning TDC channels can be detected as well. To accomplish this,
a fake trigger signal is needed at a rate of about $4 \; \symup{Hz}$. A fake signal is used to optimize 
the shape and the rate for an optimal calibration measurement. The fake signal is generated using the 
end marker of a dual timer. First, a signal is send to the START of the TDCs. Then this signal is used 
to create a delayed signal which stops the various channels. The time difference between start and stop signal was measuered with 
an oscilloscope. To ensure a good calibration, all cables 
had to be of the exact same length.\\
For all channels and for each time difference ranging from $0.5 \; \mu s$ to $4.8 \mu s$ 
at least 200 measurements have been done.
Special attention had to be given to the TDC channels which generated an overflow (i.e. a value greater than 4095)
and other anomilies.
These channels could not be fully used in the data taking since they would provide unreliable
and incomplete data. Especially the second TDC had problems regarding overflows at times greater than $3 \; \mu s$.\\
For all channels a linear function of the form 
\begin{equation*}
    \text{TDC Time} = a \cdot t + b
\end{equation*}
is fitted to the data, where $t$ represents the real time values.
These are shown for all channels in the figures \ref{fig:tdc01} to
\ref{fig:tdc1415} in \autoref{sec:tdc_figures}.
The estimated parameters are shown in \autoref{tab:tdc}. Furthermore, a $\chi^2$-test is conducted 
for all fits, although it has to be taken into account that for some fits a cut-off due to overflow of
the time values had to be done. The results of $\chi^2$-test per degree of freedom and the cut-off values 
are also shown in the table.\\
\input{content/tdc_table.tex}
With the cut-off of overflow values the $\chi^2$-test values of the fits of all channels are 
small with the biggest value being produced in channel 2 of TDC 2, which will not be used due to 
its cut-off anyway. Thus, the fits can be consired succesfull. 
For the data aquisition the channels 3, 4, 5 and 6 of both TDCs have been chosen.
In the data analysis both parameter will be used to convert the TDC times into real times although the 
offset $b$ being small in comparison to the common TDC times ranging from 0 to 4095.
