\section*{Abstract}
Muons are elementary particles which are naturally produced in the upper atmosphere of the earth due 
to cosmic rays. This experiment aims to determine the average lifetime using a plastic scintillator and
photomultipliers to detect them and a triggering system for the time measurement.\\
HERE ARE THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS!
