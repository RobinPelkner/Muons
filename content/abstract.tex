\section*{Abstract}
In this experiment, we studied cosmic muon decays using plastic scintillator detectors.
We aimed to obtain the muon lifetime by stopping the muon and measuring its decaying at 
rest to an electron. The experimental signature was given by a signal from the muon decay,
followed by a delayed signal coming from the electron. We selected muon event candidates 
and subsequently identified events with a clear sign of their decaying. Muon lifetime
is obtained from a fit to their decay time distribution. We also discussed the experimental
setup and detection techniques, taking data and analysing these data to estimate the muon 
lifetime. The muon lifetime was measured to be $2.1 \pm 0.1 \; \symup{\mu s}$.
