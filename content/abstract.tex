\section*{Abstract}
In this experiment, we studied cosmic muon decays using plastic scintillator detectors.
We aimed to obtain the muon lifetime by stopping the muon and measuring its decaying at 
rest to an electron. The experimental signature was given by a signal from the muon decay,
followed by a delayed signal coming from the electron. We selected muon event candidates 
and subsequently identified events with a clear sign of their decay. The muon lifetime
is obtained from a fit of all measured decay times.
The muon lifetime was measured to be $2.1 \pm 0.1 \; \symup{\mu s}$.\\


This report is structured as follows: in \hyperref[sec:intro]{Chapter~\ref*{sec:intro}}, an introduction to the physical aspects of muons is given.
\hyperref[sec:setup]{Chapter~\ref*{sec:setup}} describes the used components and the experimental setup. In \hyperref[sec:prem]{Chapter~\ref*{sec:prem}}
the preliminary measurements for the calibration of the setup are described and their results are discussed. \hyperref[sec:trigger]{Chapter~\ref*{sec:trigger}} discusses the composition of the experiment and the process of data taking, while \hyperref[sec:data_analysis]{Chapter~\ref*{sec:data_analysis}} presents the data analysis. \hyperref[sec:results]{Chapter~\ref*{sec:results}} concludes this report.
